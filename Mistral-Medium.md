Dear UN Country Team in Guyana,

Thank you for reaching out to me for advice on how to use AI for your programs in health, education, social protection, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and governance. I am excited to share some practical applications of AI that can be implemented within a year and have a high ROI.

**Health:**

1. **Predictive Analytics for Disease Outbreaks:** AI can be used to predict the spread of diseases and identify hotspots by analyzing data from various sources such as social media, weather patterns, and health records. An example of a successful project is [ProMed-mail](https://promedmail.org/), a global early warning system for infectious diseases that uses AI to analyze reports of disease outbreaks.
