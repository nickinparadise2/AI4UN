# Recommendations for the UN Country Team in Guyana on Utilizing AI for Humanitarian Work and International Development

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and live, and the humanitarian sector is no exception. The UN Country Team in Guyana has requested advice on how to use AI for its programs in health, education, social protection, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and governance, including eliminating Gender-Based Violence (GBV). As a leading expert on AI in humanitarian work and international development, I am excited to provide recommendations on practical applications of AI that can be implemented in under a year and can help scale the team's efforts.

## Central AI Innovation Hub

Before diving into specific AI applications, it is essential to establish a central AI Innovation Hub to coordinate all initiatives and activities. This hub will serve as a focal point for AI-related projects, bringing together international talent, local graduates, and members of the Diaspora. The hub will also facilitate collaboration with partners like Omdena, who have a highly motivated community of 20,000 AI engineers dedicated to social good projects and capacity building.

The AI Innovation Hub will be responsible for:

- Coordinating AI projects across different sectors and agencies
- Identifying and leveraging local and international talent
- Providing training and capacity building opportunities
- Ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI
- Fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among stakeholders
