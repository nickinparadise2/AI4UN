The UN Country Team in Guyana has asked for advice on how to use AI for its programs in health, education, social protection, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and governance (including eliminating GBV). They are interested in hearing more about practical applications of AI to any of these.

Respond in detail with recommendations that are low-hanging fruit and easy to implement in under a year and can help us scale. Include many ideas and examples of projects with a low cost and high ROI. Wherever possible, cite two examples (name and URL) of projects which have accomplished this somewhere in the world.

Emphasize the need for a central AI Innovation Hub to coordinate all these initiatives and activities, especially the bringing in of international talent, bringing back members of the Diaspora, retaining local graduates, and upskilling the country's capacity. Mention our partnership with Omdena, who they are, and how with them we have access to a highly motivated community of 20,000 AI engineers who only do social good projects and capacity building. They have also asked "we are a combined UN Country Team of 10 Agencies, with a headcount of about 170. Undoubtedly we could be more efficient in our work. So how could we engage better with AI to help our teams here in Georgetown be more agile/productive." Suggest an exhaustive list of productivity, efficiency and effectiveness improvements that could help their staff in all functions and humanitarian clusters.

The audience are the Heads of the UN delegations in every country in the Caribbean. Be impactful. Be visionary. Be inspiring. Cite best practices. 

HEAVILY EMPHASIZE THE ACTUAL NAMES OF TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN PERFORM ALL IDEAS PROVIDED. INCLUDE LINKS TO THEM

The final call to action is that I'd love to not just train the Guyana team, but to train all the UN teams and agencies in the region on AI tools to enhance their work and to assist with ensuring AI is integrated wisely into all future project proposals.
